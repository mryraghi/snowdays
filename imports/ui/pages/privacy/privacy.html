          <h6 class="mb-2">A. Navigation Data</h6>
          <p>
            The information systems and software procedures utilised by this internet presence collect some personal data as part of their normal function, the transmission of which is technically necessary - using the Transmission Control Protocol - to surf the internet at all. This is information that is not collected in order to identify the relevant user, although - by processing and assigning the data of third parties - based on the nature of the data it would be possible (e.g. IP address, domain name of the computer used to visit the site). These data are used solely to obtain anonymous, statistical information about visits to the site and whether it is functioning correctly. The data could be used, in the event of damage being caused deliberately to the site, to determine the initiator, and would be saved in this case. These data will not be forwarded or disseminated; if requested, they must be made available to the postal police, the court authorities and the judicial police. Navigation data may be used to determine liability in cases of IT offences to the disadvantage of snowdays website.
          </p>
          <h6 class="mb-2">B. Voluntary nature of data provision</h6>
          <p>
            The optional, explicit and voluntary sending of electronic mail and/or transmission of personal data entails the acquisition of the address and/or other possible personal data of the sender that is needed in order to respond or to perform the required service. A failure to provide this voluntary data could lead to the desired result not being achieved. This data can only be forwarded to third parties if it is required for the purpose of handling enquiries. The forwarding of data to third parties for marketing and profiling purposes is not permissible.
